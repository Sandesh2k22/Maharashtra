            <p style="font-size: 25; margin-top: px;">The Gateway of India is an iconic arch monument located on the waterfront in Mumbai’s Apollo Bunder area, overlooking the Arabian Sea. Built between 1911 and 1924, it commemorates the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India in 1911, serving as a ceremonial entrance for British viceroys and governors. Designed by architect George Wittet in the Indo-Saracenic style, the structure stands 26 meters high and features intricate latticework, four turrets, and a central dome. Over time, the Gateway has become a symbol of Mumbai and a major tourist attraction, witnessing key historical events such as the departure of the last British troops from India in 1948 and serving as a gathering place for cultural and public events. </p>

            <p style="font-size: 25;">The Ajanta Caves, located near Aurangabad in Maharashtra, are a remarkable ensemble of about 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments carved into a horseshoe-shaped cliff along the Waghora River. Created between the 2nd century BCE and the 6th century CE, these caves served as monastic retreats, prayer halls (chaityas), and residences (viharas) for Buddhist monks. They are celebrated for their exquisite frescoes and sculptures that vividly depict the life of Buddha, Jataka tales, and various aspects of ancient Indian society, showcasing the pinnacle of early Buddhist art and architecture. The caves reflect the patronage of several dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Vakatakas, Guptas, and Chalukyas, with the Vakataka king Harishena notably commissioning some of the most elaborate works. Architecturally, the caves display a sophisticated integration of rock-cut techniques with evolving artistic styles, including the influence of Gupta artistry despite the dynasty’s absence in the Deccan.

            <p style="font-size: 25;">Mahabaleshwar, often hailed as the "Queen of Hill Stations" in Maharashtra, is a picturesque hill town situated about 1,353 meters (approximately 4,500 feet) above sea level in the Sahyadri mountain range of the Western Ghats. Known for its lush greenery, cool climate, and breathtaking panoramic views, Mahabaleshwar was once the summer capital of the Bombay Presidency during British rule, and many majestic colonial-era mansions still stand as reminders of that era. The town is famous for its numerous scenic viewpoints, locally called "Points," such as Arthur's Seat, which offers stunning views of deep valleys and distant forts like Raigad and Torna, and Bombay Point, renowned for spectacular sunsets. Venna Lake, a man-made lake surrounded by tall trees and flowering gardens, is a central attraction where visitors can enjoy boating and leisurely walks. Other notable spots include Lingmala Waterfall, Echo Point, and Falkland Point, each offering unique natural beauty. </p>
