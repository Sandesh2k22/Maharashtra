            <p style="font-size: 25; margin-top: -20px;">Ganesh Chaturthi is a major Hindu festival celebrating the birth of Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed deity who is revered as the God of new beginnings, remover of obstacles, and the god of wisdom and prosperity. The festival lasts for 10 days, starting on the fourth day (Chaturthi) of the Hindu month of Bhadrapada (usually August or September).

During the festival, devotees install clay idols of Ganesha in homes and public pandals (temporary decorated stages). The idols are worshipped with prayers, chanting of Vedic hymns, offerings of sweets like modak (Ganesha’s favorite), and rituals such as Prana Pratishta (invoking life into the idol) and Shodashopachara (16-step worship). Daily prasada (blessed food) is distributed to the community, and many observe fasting and meditation.

The festival concludes with Ganpati Visarjan, a grand procession where the idol is carried to a nearby water body and immersed, symbolizing Ganesha’s return to his divine abode on Mount Kailash. This immersion also represents the cycle of birth, life, and death, and the removal of obstacles from devotees' lives. </p>

            <p style="font-size: 25;">Gudi Padwa is the traditional Marathi Hindu New Year festival celebrated predominantly in Maharashtra, as well as in Goa and parts of Karnataka. It falls on the first day of the Hindu month of Chaitra, which usually corresponds to March or April in the Gregorian calendar. In 2025, Gudi Padwa will be observed on March 30.

Significance:
New Year & New Beginnings: Gudi Padwa marks the start of the Hindu lunisolar new year and the onset of spring, symbolizing fresh starts, prosperity, and joy.

Harvest Festival: It also celebrates the end of the Rabi crop season and the beginning of the new harvest, making it especially important for farmers.

            <p style="font-size: 25;">Makar Sankranti is a vibrant and much-awaited festival in Maharashtra, celebrated on January 14th every year to mark the transition of the sun into the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara). This day heralds longer days and the end of winter, symbolizing new beginnings and prosperity. In Maharashtra, the festival is famous for the exchange of tilgul—sweets made from sesame seeds and jaggery. People greet each other with the words, “Tilgul ghya, god god bola,” which means “Accept these sweets and speak sweetly.” Women often organize special gatherings called Haldi-Kumkum, where they exchange gifts and celebrate togetherness. Kite flying is also a popular activity, filling the skies with colorful kites. Homes are decorated with rangoli, and families dress in traditional attire to perform rituals and offer prayers to the sun god. Makar Sankranti in Maharashtra is a time of warmth, joy, and community bonding, reflecting the spirit of sharing and harmony.</p>
